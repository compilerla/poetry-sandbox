# poetry-sandbox

A small devcontainer for exploring `poetry`.

## Getting started

Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/compilerla/poetry-sandbox.git`

Then open the folder in VS Code and use the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension to re-open it as a container.

See [notes](./notes) for a brief intro to `poetry` and links to more detailed resources.
